This is a direct update of its existing SBTi approved 55% reduction by 2040 target. The significance of these targets is highly limited, since scope 1 and 2 emissions account for just 2% of Carrefour’s emissions. Carrefour’s separate interim target of 29% emission reductions from scope 3 emissions by 2030 is a far more significant target, given that scope 3 emissions account for 98% of the company’s footprint, but these emissions do not appear to be covered by the headline carbon neutrality target.","70% emission reduction S1&2 by 2040, from 2019.

S3 targets are more promising, with a pledge to reduce emissions by 29% in 2030 compared to 2019 levels, as well as planning to use only renewable energy by 2030. It is unclear whether reported emissions and targets may exclude emissions from administrative buildings, warehouses, and operations outside of the nine countries that Carrefour refers to as its integrated countries, since these emissions are excluded from the company’s GHG reporting in its annual report.

emissions target to 2022
Net zero emissions refers to achieving
an overall balance between greenhouse
gases emitted in operation and
greenhouse gases removed from the
atmosphere. Getting Dexus to net
zero is an opportunity to align with
changing customer sentiment and
meet the increasing investor demands
for low-carbon investments.
We have made great progress on our
goal already and have brought forward
our target to achieve net zero emissions
to 30 June 2022, advancing our original
2030 goal by eight years. Accelerating
our net zero ambition delivers strong
climate action for our planet, enhances
our vision and customer proposition
for smart, sustainable workspaces
and ensures we will be ready for other
opportunities, including supporting our
customers on their own journey.
Our commitment to deliver net zero
emissions by 30 June 2022 will be
achieved by:
1. Our transition to 100% renewable
electricity from base building
operations from July 2021, purchasing
renewable energy in the form of
Large-scale Generation Certificates
or GreenPower
2. Continuing to invest in certified
carbon offsets for our remaining
emissions. We will purchase
accredited nature-based offsets to
account for emissions from natural
gas, wastewater, refrigerants, and
waste/recycling
3. Verifying we are net zero and
maintaining this status through
Australia’s Climate Active carbon
neutral program
In parallel with this transition, our focus
remains on improving energy efficiency
and accelerating the deployment of
on-site renewables (see pages 56-57).
Transitioning to 100% renewable
electricity will account for around
80% of scope 2 and 3 emissions, with
the remaining 20% of scope 1 and 3
emissions to be balanced through
carbon offsets.
This includes emissions for the base
building sources comprising electricity,
natural gas, diesel, refrigerant leakage,
water and wastewater, and waste and
recycling. It excludes tenant sources
such as tenancy electricity.
Enriched Environment continued
Our approach on this journey involves:
– Reducing or eliminating emissions at
source through efficiency practices and
emission-free energy
– Investing locally, prioritising Australianbased projects with a geographic
correlation to the location of our
properties to support those local
communities
– Being transparent and verifiable, by
investing in certified renewable energy
and offset schemes, and certifying
and disclosing our outcomes with
independent verification
– Making a difference in Australia’s
transition, by supporting supply chains
and the development of renewable
energy and abatement projects
In line with the Oxford Offsetting Principles,
published by the University of Oxford,
we will shift towards ‘nature-based’
carbon removal projects over emission
reduction projects due to their ability
to actively reduce atmospheric carbon
dioxide. Initially we will invest in carbon
removal projects such as tree planting
and bush regeneration projects, which
use photosynthesis to capture and
sequest carbon from the atmosphere. As
technologies develop, we will also transition
towards projects that provide higher
permanence or long-lived carbon capture.",,,https://www.dexus.com/investor-centre/results-and-reporting/asx-announcements/2021/august/2021-sustainability-report,Not Specified,,,,,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,No,,No,,Annual reporting,No,Yes,Yes,Other conditions,0.642

(Pg. 69) 2030 Goal: Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions
Description. Drive a 10% reduction in our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2020 to 2030.
Baseline. Progress measured as percent reduction from our calendar year 2019 emissions. Our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in 2019 were 2.88 million metric tons of CO2e.
Progress in 2021. During 2021, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by approximately 14% from the 2019 baseline.
Looking Ahead. In 2022, we will continue to take action to reduce emissions through abatement, investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation.
In addition to this 2030 goal, in April 2022 we announced a new commitment to reach net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Next year we will begin reporting progress toward both the 2030 and 2040 commitments. ",,"Building on its 2030 commitments, Intel has announced its target for net zero (scope 1 and 2) by 2040.

The board has ultimate responsibility for risk management, and their decision-making takes climate-related risks into account. In 2019,
we added climate change risk oversight to the charter of the Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility (HES&CR) committee of the board of directors to highlight how seriously we approach robust understanding and evaluation of climate risk. This committee meets at least twice per year to understand and monitor climate-related trends, issues, legislation, policies, practices and concerns.
Our executive vice president of Operations, who reports directly to the CEO, has leadership responsibility for climate-related issues. He provides regular updates to the board regarding performance.
Our vice president of Health, Environment, Safety, Security (HES&S) and Corporate Sustainability, who reports to the executive vice president of Operations, has leadership accountability for driving our corporate sustainability programs. This role provides the strategic focus necessary to align all areas of our corporate ESG strategy and embed sustainability practices into the way we run our business.

• Conversion of existing field gas pneumatic actuated controllers to instrument air or electric-action, permanently reducing methane emissions. Future devices installed on Marathon Oil-owned equipment will be instrument air or electric-action.
• Purchase of renewable energy credits (RECs) to fully offset 2021 Scope 2 emissions created from purchased electricity use.
• Improved gas capture.
• Optimization of compression associated with gas lift

""Driving significant and continuous reductions to our GHG emissions intensity is a core part of our strategy to mitigate the longer-term market risks related to climate change. Our GHG reduction initiatives are supported by transparent, quantitative objectives intended to promote accountability and ingenuity throughout our organization.

Newcrest sets goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050
Newcrest’s Purpose is “To create a brighter future for people through safe and responsible mining”.
This Purpose underpins our commitment to take on the challenge of climate change and to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions.
Our goal is net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Newcrest is taking action to manage climate change risks and opportunities.
In June 2019, we released our Climate Change Policy which outlined our commitment to the sustainable discovery,
development and production of gold and copper, together with our plans to identify, assess and report our responses to climate
change challenges.
This Policy continues to direct our actions to build a sustainable, resilient business which will thrive in a low carbon future,
encompassing:
• a better understanding of the life-cycle GHG emissions for the gold and copper value chains
• increasing the transparency of our climate change reporting of performance metrics and targets
• reporting our energy use, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our performance against targets annually
• working with our suppliers and customers to better understand our Scope 3 emissions
• ensuring that our measuring, reporting and verification processes are robust across all operating sites
• assessing options to increase our use of renewable power and low emission energy technologies
• focusing on opportunities to improve our energy efficiency to reduce energy used and reduce direct mining costs
• identifying and pursuing best practices in the mining and metals industry and partner with technology developers
• assessing climate change scenarios and the projected future price of energy in our medium to long term portfolio
analysis
• partnering with experts and research organisations to identify potential physical threats from climate change at our
current and planned operating sites and invest in appropriate adaptation responses to build resilience
• contributing constructively to policy development in our host countries.
In June 2019 we also set a target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 against our FY18 baseline.
We are making progress.
• We have developed GHG Management Plans for each operating site to understand the abatement opportunities.
• We have directly linked achievement of the actions detailed in these plans to senior executive incentive payments.
• We are progressively improving the measurement of our GHG emissions across our full value chain.
• We are increasing our use of renewable sources of energy. For example, we have entered an agreement to purchase
40% of the energy requirements of our Cadia operation from a wind farm which is expected to be generating from
2024.
• We are well advanced in assessing the risks and opportunities for our business under selected climate change
scenarios in line with the Paris Agreement goals.
Newcrest now wishes to set a new longer-term goal, which is to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal will apply
to our operational (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions.
We will also continue working across our value chain to reduce Scope 3 emissions.
We will continue to be guided by our Climate Change Policy as we pursue this.
Our energy and emissions performance is reported in our Sustainability Reports and we support the Taskforce on Climaterelated Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations for reporting climate change risks and opportunities.","Climate change update

We are mobilised to adapt to climate change and minimise our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions through several steps:
• assess our carbon footprint across our whole supply chain, from packaging and raw material procurement, to consumer-generated waste. this helps us understand and anticipate our impact on the environment and on climate.
• commit to ambitious science-based targets to align with the goals of the paris agreement and track our progress in reducing emissions.
• reduce the energy consumption of our sites and move from fossil fuels to renewable energy, such as biomass, biogas, or renewable electricity.
• work with our suppliers to help them reduce their emissions: decreasing their energy consumption for instance, or reducing fertilizer use in fields, or optimising transportation loading and routes",https://www.pernod-ricard.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/PERNOD%20RICARD%20ANNUAL%20REPORT%20FY21.pdf,Carbon dioxide and other GHGs,,,,,Yes,Yes,No,No,"

In addition to the details of P&G’s net zero ambition, the Climate Transition Action Plan covers the entire lifecycle emissions of our products and packaging, across supply chain, operations, consumer use of our products, and product end of life. P&G also issued a TCFD aligned report and responded to CDP’s Climate Survey. ""","American consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble commits to reduce emissions from operations 50% by 2030 from a 2010 base-year. Within this timeframe, the company will also address the main source of emissions across its value chain by measures including: ensuring that 70% of all washing machine loads are washed in cold water, doubling the use of post-consumer resin in plastic packaging and ensuring zero deforestation in the palm oil supply chain. Read the Procter & Gamble Case Study.

The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to Well-below 2°C.

Sabancı Holding CEO Cenk Alper joined the ""Squawk Box Europe"" program on CNBC Europe and evaluated Sabancı Holding's sustainability goals. Sabancı Holding CEO Cenk Alper stated that he sees sustainability as an integral part of the Group's purpose and strategy. Mr. Alper also shared Sabancı Holding's sustainability goals and the Group's sustainability roadmap with the audience.

“We unite Turkey and the world for a sustainable life with leading enterprises”

Mr. Alper said: “Last year we revised our Group’s common purpose as: ‘We unite Turkey and the world for a sustainable life with leading enterprises.’ We have also prepared a 5-year strategic plan based on the findings of a comprehensive study we conducted across our entire Group to foresee the post-pandemic world. This plan includes 5 strategic directions that we believe will lead us to our Group’s goal: Provide wider customer experience, transform into an agile global/local footprint, pioneer in sustainability, lead in digital & material technologies and adapt to future of work. In addition, as the Group, we announced our long-term sustainability goals by committing to reach 'Net Zero Emissions’ by 2050.”

“We have drawn different roadmaps for all our group activities”

Sabancı Holding CEO Cenk Alper said that some solutions needed for net zero emissions and zero waste are not yet technologically possible: “We have drawn a long roadmap, we want to implement it. Within the group, we analyzed all our group activities and drew different roadmaps for each and single entity. Some of these goals and activities towards zero carbon emissions are clear now, but if the necessary solution is not available in the world, we will join the worldwide networks to find the necessary solutions. We plan to achieve half of our goals by 2030. We talk about this at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We need to set our goals on a science-based year basis, we have to reach half of our goals by 2030, otherwise we will miss the 2050 target.” https://www.sabanci.com/en/news-detail/we-have-to-reach-half-of-our-sustainability-goals-by-2030",,https://www.sabanci.com/en/news-detail/sabanci-holding-leads-sustainability-with-its-zero-emission-goal,Carbon dioxide and other GHGs,,,,,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,No,,No,,No reporting mechanism,No,No,Not Specified,,10.7

To accomplish the challenge of achieving the Zero CO2 emissions from vehicle by 2050, SECOM will take a two-step approach: the radically “reducing” step, and then the completely “eliminating” step. For the “reducing” step, we will first reduce distances traveled by vehicles, enhancing the technology of remote monitoring and promoting operational efficiency. Then we will take measures to replace all 4,000 vehicles to “Top runner vehicles” (next-generation vehicles). For the second “eliminating” step, we will challenge the “Well-to-Wheel” Zero emission for fuels, eliminating CO2 “from the oil field to the tire.”",,,https://www.secom.co.jp/english/csr/infra/environment/warming.html,Not Specified,,,,,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,No,,Yes,"Information on the extent to which measures will be applied (e.g. if switching to EVs, what share of the fleet; if installing an own solar PV installation, what is the installed capacity)",No reporting mechanism,No,Not Specified,Not Specified,,0

However, greenhouse gas emissions during the retail sale of power, which account for the majority of Scope 3 emissions, must be estimated and reported in accordance with the Law Concerning the Promotion of the Measures to Cope with Global Warming. Therefore, the TEPCO Group has set a target of reducing CO2 emissions originating from the sale of power by 50% (of 
FY2013 levels) by the year FY2030. CO2 emissions in FY2013 were 139.2 million tons. By promoting the use of renewable energies and procured electricity from highly efficient thermal power stations, in FY2020 we were able to reduce this amount to 83.6 million tons (quick estimate), which corresponds to approximately 80% of our target. We will continue to further promote the use of renewable energies and recommence operation of nuclear power stations in order to achieve our target.

WesCEF recognises it has a role to play in addressing climate change and reducing its carbon footprint for current and future generations. WesCEF has always been an early adopter of emissions reduction technology. The installation of catalysts in its nitric acid plants from 2011 has resulted in a significant reduction in emissions. In the 2021 financial year, 742,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions were avoided using this technology. As the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the Wesfarmers Group, WesCEF currently emits approximately 880,000 tonnes a year of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, primarily from its Chemicals businesses. Reducing WesCEF's Carbon Footprint WesCEF aspires to net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050, which it aims to achieve through investment in research, technology, energy and transport efficiency, and process optimisation. To ensure climate change is coordinated and managed across WesCEF, a Climate Change Policy was introduced this year, along with the formation of a dedicated Climate Opportunities team to lead the organisation’s development of a roadmap to achieve WesCEF’s emissions reduction target. Wide consultation with key internal and external stakeholders will inform the roadmap and when complete, the roadmap will guide WesCEF’s focus on abatement efforts. At present, no known cost-effective technologies exist for WesCEF to attain net zero emissions while maintaining Wesfarmers’ objective of providing a satisfactory return to shareholders. However, WesCEF also recognises there is considerable investment and innovation with respect to climate change and it expects rapid technology development in the coming years. As a result, the roadmap will be a living document that will evolve as technology develops. A range of climate change initiatives are also either underway or being investigated, including: becoming a founding member of the Australian Energy Transition Initiative, which involves other industrial giants as well as banks, superannuation companies and not-for-profit organisations, aiming to develop pathways and actions that can accelerate emissions reductions across whole supply chains sponsoring CSIRO research into carbon capture and utilisation options continuing to improve the abatement catalysts in our nitric acid plants which convert greenhouse gases into passive, inactive gases that are safe for the environment, to limit nitrous oxide emissions.

We will reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 63%
from our 2015 baseline by 2030 – this represents
our direct operational emissions and our emissions
from electricity use. This target has been ratified
by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an
independent global body formed by the United
Nations Global Compact, CDP, the World Resources
Institute and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature.
The SBTi assesses and approves companies’
targets through a scientific lens, ensuring
alignment with the Paris Agreement goal
of limiting climate change to an increase
of 1.5 degrees above pre‑industrial levels.
To achieve this target globally, it is forecast that
net positive carbon emissions will be required.
This is why we have set our 2050 (or earlier)
goal, encompassing scope 1 and 2 emissions,
to go beyond net zero.
Our ambition is to remove more emissions from
the atmosphere than we are responsible for. Our
strategies to achieve this will continue to evolve
over this time horizon and will be communicated
in our sustainability updates and annual reports.
Our main sources of scope 1 (direct) emissions
include emissions from fugitive synthetic
refrigerants, natural gas, transport fuel, stationary
LPG and diesel for onsite back‑up generators,
while our scope 2 (indirect) emissions are those
associated with electricity use. Purchased electricity
represents 82% of our combined scope 1 and 2
emissions, in F21 accounting for 1.91 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2
e). The next
most significant category being refrigerant gases.
This year, we emitted over 2.31 million tonnes of
CO2
e from facilities across the Group (scope 1 and
2 emissions). Positively, our current emissions are
27% below our 2015 baseline. This continues our
positive trend on emission reductions on both an
absolute basis as well as an intensity measure.
We intend to reduce our scope 3 emissions by
19% from our 2015 baseline. These represent
the emissions in our value chain. Our scope 3
emissions include fuel consumption by our logistics
transport, business travel and home delivery and
trolley collection services. Our value chains are
complex and we are working to improve our data
to enable us to better understand our scope 3
